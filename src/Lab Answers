What pieces of code help versus obscure your understanding of the algorithm?
Helps: Print lines that show what data is being printed
Obscure: the entire code is in the main function so it's hard to tell what the sequence and overall functionality of the program is doing

What comments might be helpful within the code?
Steps, different heuristics (i.e. when the code is doing the in-order versus decreasing-order algorithms), describing conditions for if statements

Are there places where the code could be more concise and also more clear?
Yes, the print statements are repetitive, the two heuristics are carried out in the same function when they should be separated

Testability
How would you test this code for bugs?

Give a specific example of a "test case" as the code is currently written.
What additional functions may be helpful?
Give a specific example of a "test case" for your new function.
Extensibility
What Code Smells can you find?
What suggestions does this code make about how someone would extend it in the future to compare the performance of a wider variety of fitting algorithms?
What dependencies are there between different parts of the code?
How easy to find are those dependencies?
Can you clarify or remove those dependencies?
