What pieces of code help versus obscure your understanding of the algorithm?


What comments might be helpful within the code?
Are there places where the code could be more concise and also more clear?

Testability
How would you test this code for bugs?
Run it on different text files and see if it works. Run it on test files with very simple numbers and manually compare
the answer from the program with something done by hand.

Give a specific example of a "test case" as the code is currently written.


What additional functions may be helpful?
Give a specific example of a "test case" for your new function.

Extensibility
What Code Smells can you find?
1. "The Bloaters". The entire functinality of "Bins" is contained in the main method of the bins.java file.
 
What suggestions does this code make about how someone would extend it in the future to compare the performance of a wider variety of fitting algorithms?


What dependencies are there between different parts of the code?


How easy to find are those dependencies?


Can you clarify or remove those dependencies?
